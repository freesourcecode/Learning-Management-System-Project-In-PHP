#  Learning Management System Project in PHP with Source Code
Good day everyone, I just want to share my developed system which is entitled as Learning Management System Project in PHP.

This is a portal **e-learning Management system Project** in which all the information or the learning information are stored in the database.

# What is Learning Management System Project in PHP?
The **Learning Management System Project in PHP** is a project created using PHP programming language that can be used in a classroom based setup. 

Wherein, the instructor can only upload the module or topic to the system and the student can only interact with the system and follow the instructions in the module set by the instructors.

# What are the materials that can be uploaded to Learning Management System?
The materials can be uploaded to the system could be images, topics, videos and many other instructional materials used in the classroom.

Meaning the topics that are posted or displayed on the website are added without editing the source code of the system. 

There is another page in the system in which authorized users can have access then they can post their topics there.

Unlike with the typical e-learning system which there is no database and only the design.

Let’s discuss first what is E-Learning. E-Learning is learning by utilizing electronic technologies to access educational curriculum outside of a traditional classroom. In most cases, it refers to a course, program, or degree delivered completely on-line.

Then now, let me give an idea about a web portal.
# Web Portal
A **Web portal** is most often a specially designed web site that brings information together from diverse sources in a uniform way.

Usually, each information source gets its dedicated area on the page for displaying information (a portlet); often, the user can configure which ones to display. 

Variants of portals include mashups and intranet “dashboards” for executives and managers.

The extent to which content is displayed in a “uniform way” may depend on the intended user and the intended purpose, as well as the diversity of the content.

Very often design emphasis is on a certain “metaphor” for configuring and customizing the presentation of the content and the chosen implementation framework and/or code libraries.

In addition, the role of the user in an organization may determine which content can be added to the portal or deleted from the portal configuration.

The system has been developed with the following programming languages. PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
